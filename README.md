# Messenger SDK Implementation Comparison By Language

This is a very simple example of a trivial application that listens to a webhook from the Messenger SDK platform and then sends an echo back to the sender.

The purpose of this was to get a feel of idioms from other languages. I the author personally am most familiar with Javascript flavors (Node & Typescript).

I welcome any feedback to increase any language(s) readability and adhere to the idioms of that community.
